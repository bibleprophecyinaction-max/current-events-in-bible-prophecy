# Current Events in the Light of Bible Prophecy

Many people today are troubled by wars, global unrest, moral decline, pandemics, and growing deception.  
The Holy Bible clearly speaks about such times and gives us guidance and hope.

## What the Bible Says About These Times
- **Matthew 24** – Wars, famines, earthquakes, deception
- **2 Timothy 3:1–5** – Perilous times in the last days
- **Luke 21** – Distress of nations, fear upon the earth
- **Revelation** – Global deception and final judgment

## Why Current Events Matter
Current global events are not random. When viewed through Scripture, patterns begin to emerge that point toward the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. This is not to create fear, but to awaken hearts and call people to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.
